        3 Quotes From Darth Vader
    </h1>
    <br>
    <h2 class="center">
        1. “Just for once let me look on you with my own eyes… You were right. You were right about me. Tell your sister you were right.” — Star Wars: Episode VI — Return of the Jedi
    </h2>

        There are a ton of memorable declarations of power and authority attributed to Vader throughout the films, but this quiet, mournful moment still deserves inclusion among them. Rising up to defend his son Luke (Mark Hamill) against the Emperor, Vader knows his demise is imminent and asks his son to remove his mask so that he can truly gaze into his son’s eyes for the first and final time. It’s a tragic end to a terrifying villain, but Vader’s death — in which he confirms Luke’s assertions that there is still good in him — makes it clear that he is in some ways a victim himself.

        2. “The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner. Now I am the master.” — Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope
    </h2>

        George Lucas wouldn’t make Revenge of the Sith for another 28 years after A New Hope hit theaters. So when Vader faces off with Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness), viewers have no context for their relationship other than the clues sprinkled throughout the film. This fatal encounter includes the most blatant references to their shared past without spoiling the sequel’s revelation (more on that in a moment). Moreover, it reveals the saga’s cyclical nature and is just so damn fun to repeat to adversaries in everyday life.

        3. “No, I am your father.” — Star Wars: Episode V — The Empire Strikes Back
    </h2>

    <p class="p3 center">
        Could any other moment top this list? Sure, we all know about this twist now, but in 1980, moviegoers had their collective minds blown by the fact that Vader is, in fact, Luke’s father. More than just a brilliant twist, it deepens the emotional stakes to the film in innumerable ways, developing its character relationships and creating far more suspense in the father and son rematch that would follow in Return of the Jedi. Just don’t fall into the trap of misquoting the line as “Luke, I am your father,” as so many frequently do.
